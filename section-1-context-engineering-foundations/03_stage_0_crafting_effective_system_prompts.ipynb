    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Stage 0. Before we dive into building complex retrieval systems, we need to define who our agent is. In this preliminary stage, we'll focus on the foundation of all context: system context.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Define system context: Understand how to set an agent's role, capabilities, and constraints through system instructions.\n",
    "2.  Evaluate system prompt effectiveness: You'll experiment with different system instructions and observe how they change agent behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dive in."

    "### What Are System Instructions?\n",
    "\n",
    "System instructions (also called system prompts) are the *persistent context* that defines your agent's identity and behavior. They are included in every conversation turn and tell the LLM:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Who it is** - Role and identity\n",
    "2.  **What it can do** - Capabilities and tools\n",
    "3.  **How it should behave** - Personality and constraints\n",

    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's set up our environment. For this notebook, we're using the Stage 1 Baseline RAG agent as our foundation (located in the `/progressive_agents` directory). Don't worry about the internals yet — it's a basic retrieval pipeline that searches for courses and generates responses. We'll dive deep into how it works in the next notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key thing to understand here is that we're importing a special function called `set_system_instructions`. This hook allows us to dynamically override the agent's system prompt without modifying the source code — perfect for experimenting!\n",
